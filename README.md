# BON
The amazingly fast decompiler for Minecraft mods!

Get the precompiled version here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2944265/mods/BON.jar

To run BON, just download the precompiled version or build the version off of this repository w/ one of the provided build scripts and double-click the jar.

## Usage
NOTE: You must have a compiled and recompiled Forge copy to reference before using BON to deobfuscate a Forge mod!

Command line version (for experts only):
	Run `java -cp BON.jar immibis.bon.cui.MCPRemap` for a detailed list of command-line arguments.

BON automatically deletes the META-INF, so you don't need to do that yourself.
